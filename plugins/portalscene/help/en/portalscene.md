#PortalScene

No idea for where and when to set a scene when characters hop through a Portal or use a Key of which the destination is unknown? Look no further. This generator tries to suggest a combination of location and activity for using a Key or Portal with an unknown destination. 

Not every suggestion is going to make sense in combination; you probably will not find a red carpet opera premiere on board a B52 bomber plane over Hamburg in '43. Pick the bits that inspire you and ignore the rest!

`[portalscene]` - Generates a random prompt or suggestion to inspire you.

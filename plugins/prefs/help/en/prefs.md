# RP Preferences

The preferences command lets you record your roleplay interests (or disinterests) and find similarly-minded players. You can view and edit preferences on character profiles on the web portal, and see a summary on the [Preferences](/prefs) page.

`prefs [<player>]` - Views someone's preferences.  Leave off the name to view your own.
`prefs/notes=<...>` - Sets your prefs note. This is a freeform field which can hold items not in hte main list, or explain choices in more detail.
`prefs/notes` - Clears your notes field.
`prefs/list` - Shows you all the game-wide prefs and their shortnames that you use to set them.
`pref/set <shortname>=<level>` - Sets a preference. Levels can be given as Red/Yellow/Green, R/Y/G, or 1/2/3, whichever you prefer to use.
`pref <shortname>` - Shows you which players have set the chosen preference at which levels.

  
This system uses Faraday's prefs plugin as its starting point, which was in turn inspired by the +prefs system designed by Cobaltasaurus@MSB.

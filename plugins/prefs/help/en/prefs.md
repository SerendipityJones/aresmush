# RP Preferences

The preferences command lets you record your roleplay interests (or disinterests) and find similarly-minded players.  Preferences are a free-form field. You can view and edit preferences on character profiles on the web portal, and see a summary on the [Preferences](/prefs) page.

> Note: Unless your game is full-consent, setting a preference to 'no' does not necessarily mean you'll never have to deal with it.  Consult your local game policies for details.

`prefs [<player>]` - Views someone's preferences.  Leave off the name to view your own.
`pref/set <prefs>` - Sets your preferences. Leave the prefs blank to clear them.
`prefs/search <prefs>` - Search for preferences.

Admins with the `manage_prefs` permission can also set other peoples' preferences:

`pref/set <name>=<prefs>` - Set someone else's preferences.
  
This system is inspired by the +prefs system designed by Cobaltasaurus@MSB.
